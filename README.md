Graceful degradation is about building an application that just works when advanced features fail. Whereas, service workers enables network-level graceful degradation by intercepting requests and serving cached assets when the network is slow or absent. This way it ensures that the app degrades into a fully functional offline experience rather than showing a browser error.
